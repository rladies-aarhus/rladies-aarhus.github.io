  We are the Aarhus, Denmark chapter of [R-Ladies
  Global](https://www.rladies.org) to promote gender
  diversity in the R community. We meetup in person or virtually to
  learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools.

  We welcomes those of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or
  aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring,
  networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our
  members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning &
  sharing. We work towards supporting minority identity access to STEM skills &
  careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R
  community!

  We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities,
  with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to
  provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who
  is interested in working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or
  charge to participate in any of our events. You can access our presentations,
  R scripts, and Projects here on this website, on our [Github account](https://github.com/rladies-aarhus)
  and follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesAarhus) to stay up to
  date about R-Ladies news! Join our [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-aarhus/)
  to be informed on projects

  Make sure you read and comply with our [code of conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/).

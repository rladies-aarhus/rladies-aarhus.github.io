description: We are the Aarhus chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://www.rladies.org), 
    an organisation that promotes gender diversity in the
    R community worldwide. We meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R
    programming language, algorithms and advanced tools. 
    R-Ladies welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new
    or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring,
    networking & expert upskilling.
